### Simple Explanation
- A *data structure* is a way to organize and store data in a computer so that we can use it efficiently.

- some common data structures and their basic forms:
 ```js
// 1️⃣ Array – like a row of boxes
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

// 2️⃣ Object – like a labeled cupboard
let student = { name: "Gokul", age: 22, grade: "A" };

// 3️⃣ Stack – like a pile of plates
let stack = [];
stack.push("plate1");
stack.push("plate2");
stack.pop(); // removes the top plate

// 4️⃣ Queue – like a line of people
let queue = [];
queue.push("person1");
queue.push("person2");
queue.shift(); // removes the first person in line

```
