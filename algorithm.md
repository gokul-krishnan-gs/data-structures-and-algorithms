### Let’s say we want to make an algorithm to find the biggest number in a list 👇

- Step-by-step algorithm:

1. Start

2. Assume the first number is the biggest

3. Compare each number with the biggest one

4. If a bigger number is found, update it

5. At the end, the biggest number is the answer

6. Stop

### Code
```js
let numbers = [10, 5, 20, 8];
let biggest = numbers[0];

for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] > biggest) {
    biggest = numbers[i];
  }
}

console.log("Biggest number is:", biggest);
```
