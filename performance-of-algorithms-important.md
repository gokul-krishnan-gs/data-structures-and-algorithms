# Algorithm Performance: Why Speed Matters 🚀


Imagine you have two delivery boys 🚴‍♂️ delivering pizzas 🍕

* **Boy A** takes 5 minutes per delivery.
* **Boy B** takes 30 minutes per delivery.

Both deliver pizzas correctly (so both are user-friendly and accurate), but Boy A can deliver 6 pizzas in the same time Boy B delivers 1 pizza!

**Who do you think the shop will prefer?** 👉 The faster one, because speed = more happy customers = better performance.

That's why performance matters in algorithms — even if your program is correct, if it's slow, users will leave!

## 💡 Simple Explanation

**Performance** means how fast and efficiently an algorithm solves a problem.

If an algorithm is slow or uses too much memory, then even a user-friendly, secure, or beautiful app will feel bad to use.

That's why performance is like **currency** 💰 — you can "buy" user-friendliness, security, and all other good things only if your program runs fast and smooth.

### Performance matters because a fast algorithm makes everything else possible — speed, efficiency, and happy users.
